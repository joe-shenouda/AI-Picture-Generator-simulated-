This project implements a simple web-based AI Picture Generator using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows users to input text descriptions and generates corresponding images using AI technology.

## Demo

Check out the live demo: [AI Picture Generator](https://joe-shenouda.github.io/AI-Picture-Generator-simulated-/)

## Features

- **Text-to-Image Generation**: Users can input text descriptions to generate images.
- **Responsive Design**: The interface is designed to work well on various screen sizes.
- **Simulated API Integration**: The current version simulates API calls for demonstration purposes.

## Structure

The application consists of a single HTML file that includes embedded CSS and JavaScript:

- HTML: Defines the structure of the web page.
- CSS: Styles the page elements for an attractive and responsive design.
- JavaScript: Handles user interactions and simulates image generation.

## Key Components

1. **Input Form**: 
   - Textarea for entering image descriptions
   - Submit button to trigger image generation

2. **Result Display**:
   - Area to show the generated image and description

3. **Feature Highlights**:
   - Advanced AI
   - Endless Creativity
   - Lightning Fast Generation

## Usage

1. Open the HTML file in a web browser.
2. Enter a description of the image you want to generate in the textarea.
3. Click the "Generate Picture" button.
4. Wait for the image to be "generated" (simulated in this version).
5. View the resulting image displayed below the form.

## Customization

- The base URL can be changed by modifying the `<base>` tag in the `<head>` section.
- Styles can be adjusted in the `<style>` section to match your preferred design.
- To implement actual API integration, replace the simulated API call in the JavaScript section with a real API endpoint.

## Dependencies

- Font Awesome (5.15.3) for icons

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/joe-shenouda/AI-Picture-Generator-simulated-.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```
   cd AI-Picture-Generator-simulated-
   ```
3. Open `index.html` in your web browser.

## Note

This is a front-end demonstration. The actual image generation is simulated using placeholder images. To create a fully functional AI image generator, you would need to integrate with a backend service that provides AI image generation capabilities.
